	-//p[1] for the first paragraph
	
	-//div[@class="full-script"]/text()  to get the text only
	
	-//p[@class="plot"]/text()
	
	-//p[(@class="plot") or (@class="plot 2")]/text()

Special Characters

that help in ease while using the Xpath

/ single slash character

// double slash character

//div/text() will only give the value in this node

//div/p1/text() will give the value in the child nodes

we first have to write the element before /text()

//text() locate element at any level in the documente automatically

 //div//text() will display the text at any level in a document
 
 //p/. the p node itself will return 
 
 if we write //p/.. its parent node will be returned
 
 //h1/.. 
 
 
/* will select all the childern elements 

@ select the attribute

() for grouping

[n] represent index which index should be selected
