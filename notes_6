Building The Bot

In this video, we are going to handle pagination with selenium

We are going to scrap audible

Initially we are going to scrape one page, later on we are going to scrape multiple pages

Let's start writing the code 

But first go to the target website and:

	-Inspect it 
	
	-First inspect the title of the first movie or book
	
	-Then go to its parent 
	
	-Finally you will know the container div class that contains all the books
