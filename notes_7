We are gonna learn how to login to website using selenium

Logging to website using webscrapping is not a good practice

By doing this your ip can get blocked but also your account can get blocked 

Let see some code to login to twitter through selenium:

	-Code:
	
	from selenium import webdriver
	import time
	import os

	web = "https://twitter.com/i/flow/login"
	# path = "/Users/frankandrade/Downloads/chromedriver"
	driver = webdriver.Chrome()
	driver.get(web)
	driver.maximize_window()

	# wait of 6 seconds to let the page load the content
	time.sleep(6)  # this time might vary depending on your computer

	# locating username and password inputs and sending text to the inputs
	# username
	username = driver.find_element('xpath','//input[@autocomplete ="username"]')
	username.send_keys("janeebee1092@gmail.com")  # Write Email Here
	# username.send_keys(os.environ.get("TWITTER_USER"))

	# Clicking on "Next" button
	next_button = driver.find_element('xpath','//div[@role="button"]//span[text()="Next"]')
	next_button.click()

	# wait of 2 seconds after clicking button
	time.sleep(2)

	# password
	password = driver.find_element('xpath','//input[@autocomplete ="current-password"]')
	password.send_keys("90as()nm")  # Write Password Here
	# password.send_keys(os.environ.get("TWITTER_PASS"))

	# locating login button and then clicking on it
	login_button = driver.find_element('xpath','//div[@role="button"]//span[text()="Log in"]')
	login_button.click()


	# closing driver
	# driver.quit()
	
By the above code you will automate the process of logging into the twitter by using username/email and password

Half of the video is done on the Laptop, so u can also get the content from there as well

Infinite Scrolling

We are going into infinite scrolling.

Infinite Scrolling:

	-In some sites, when we scroll down, new content loads. This is known as the infinite scrollin. Selenium is the best way to handle infinite scrolling
	
	-We are going to scrape a page which has infinite scrolling
	
	-Choose tweet which has some limited comments 
	
	-334 comments tweets
	
	-click on the tweet
	
	-copy the address of the tweet	
	
	-Code for infinite scrolling is below:
		
		from selenium import webdriver
		from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
		from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
		from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
		import pandas as pd
		import time

		web = "https://twitter.com/HulkHogan/status/922554774633009153"
		driver = webdriver.Chrome()
		driver.get(web)
		driver.maximize_window()

		last_height=driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
		while True:
		    driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight)") # this script will make it sure that the script will run through out the height of the page
		    time.sleep(5) # to sleep 
		    new_height=driver.execute_script("return document.body.scrollHeight")
		    if new_height==last_height:
			break
		    else:
			last_height=new_height
		driver.quit()
